This is Fengshi's homepage!

Hi, there! This is Fengshi Tian, a senior student majoring Microelectronics @ Fudan University. I also go by Claire. Now I am a visiting research student at Westlake University working with Prof. Mohamad SAWAN (Chair Professor, FIEEE, FCAE) & Dr. Jie YANG.

I ever worked as Research Assistant in two labs at Fudan University. Now my research interest lie in Neuromorphic Computing and AI chip design. I am going to become a PhD student at AI Chip Center for Emerging Smart Systems(ACCESS) of HKUST in Aug. 2021, where I will work with Prof. Tim CHENG (Dean of SENG, Chair Professor, FIEEE) & Prof. Chi-Ying Tsui. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions. My e-mail: fstian17@fudan.edu.cn

My future goal is to become a scientist or engineer. I will always focus on the field of electronic&computer engineering and chase the most cutting-edge technology.

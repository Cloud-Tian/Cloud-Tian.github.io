This is Fengshi's webpage!

This is Fengshi Tian, a coming senior student majoring Microelectronics at Fudan University. Now I am a visiting student at Westlake University.

I have worked as Research Assistant in two labs at Fudan University. Now my research interest lie in Neuromorphic Computing and AI chip&hardware design. I am going to become a PhD student at HKUST in Aug. 2021. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions. My e-mail: fstian17@fudan.edu.cn

My future goal is to become a scientist or engineer. I will always focus on the field of electronic&compyter engineering and chase the most cutting-edge technology.
